# 💼 Salary Prediction Machine Learning App

A complete **Machine Learning–powered web application** built using **Streamlit** that predicts employee salary based on years of experience.

This project demonstrates the **end-to-end ML workflow** — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment using an interactive web interface.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Salary prediction is a classic **supervised regression problem**. This application uses **Linear Regression** to learn patterns from historical salary data and provides **real-time predictions** through a user-friendly UI.

**Problem Statement:** Can we accurately predict salary using years of experience?

**Solution Approach:**
- Train a Linear Regression model on historical data
- Save the model using `joblib`
- Load into a Streamlit web application
- Enable real-time salary predictions via user input

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Interactive Streamlit web interface
- 🧠 Machine Learning with Scikit-learn
- 📁 CSV-based dataset
- 💾 Saved trained model (`.joblib`)
- ⚡ Real-time predictions
- 📉 Data preprocessing
- 🧪 Jupyter Notebook for training & analysis
